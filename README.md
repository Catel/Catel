## Features and components

Below are a few features that are available in Catel.

### Catel.Core

Catel.Core is the library you want to include in all your projects, whether you are writing a UI project or not. It contains lots of useful helper methods. The
most important features are listed below:

- Argument validation (e.g. `Argument.IsNotNull(() => myArgument)`)
- Caching
- Data (ModelBase, PropertyBag, Validation)
- IoC (ServiceLocator, TypeFactory)
- Logging (LogManager, Log, several log listeners)
- Messaging
- Reflection (same reflection API for *every supported platform*)
- Serialization (BinarySerializer, XmlSerializer and more)
- Weak references (WeakEventListener)

And more.... 

### Catel.MVVM

Catel.MVVM is the library you want to include when you are writing a UI project (e.g. WPF, UWP, Xamarin) and you want to use the MVVM pattern. Catel is the *only* MVVM library that has context-aware view and view-model creation, which can be used to solve the [nested user controls problem](https://docs.catelproject.com/vnext/introduction/mvvm/introduction-to-nested-user-controls-problem/). 

The most important
features are listed below:

- Auditing
- Collections (FastObservableCollection)
- Commands (Command, TaskCommand, etc)
- Converters (tons of converters out of the box)
- Services
	- CameraService	
	- LocationService
	- MessageService
	- NavigationService
	- OpenFileService
	- PleaseWaitService
	- SaveFileService
	- UIVisualizerService
- View models
	- Automatic validation
	- Automatic mappings from model to view model
- Views
	- DataWindow
	- UserControl
	- Window

## Example code

### Models

This model has automatic change notifications and validation.

```csharp
public class Person : ValidatableModelBase
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    public string LastName { get; set; }

    protected override void ValidateFields(List<IFieldValidationResult> validationResults)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhitespace(FirstName))
        {
            validationResults.Add(FieldValidationResult.CreateError(nameof(FirstName), "First name is required"));
        }

        if (string.IsNullOrWhitespace(LastName))
        {
            validationResults.Add(FieldValidationResult.CreateError(nameof(LastName), "Last name is required"));
        }
    }    
}
```

### View models

This is a view model with:

- Automatic injection of the DataContext
- Automatic mapping of properties & validation from model => view model

```csharp
public class PersonViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
    public PersonViewModel(Person person)
    {
        Argument.IsNotNull(() => person);

        Person = person;
    }

    [Model]
    private Person Person { get; set; }

    [ViewModelToModel]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    [ViewModelToModel]
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```
